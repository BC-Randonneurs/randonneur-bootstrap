## Requirements

- `yarn`

How to customize:

1. `yarn` to install
2. Make your edits
3. `yarn build` to do processing

If you have your directory structure as follows:

```
your-rando-root/
├── randonneur-database/
│   └── bcrdatabase/
└── randonneur-bootstrap/
...
└── randonneur-wp/
```

You can run:
```
yarn build-and-copy
```

to copy the files to the right directory
