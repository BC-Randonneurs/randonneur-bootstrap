## Requirements

- `yarn`

How to customize:

# `yarn` to install

# Make your edits

# `yarn build-project`

If you have your directory structure as follows:

```
your-rando-root/
├── bcrdata/
│   └── bcrdatabase/
└── randonneur-bootstrap/
|
└── randopony-tetra/
|   └── randopony/
|
...
└── randonneur-wp/
```

You can run:

`yarn build-db`

or

`yarn build-pony`

to copy the files to the right directory
